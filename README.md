# Minecraft: Bedrock Source 
Class names are mapped with the mappings.txt This was mainly generated by a program so it may contain some classes in the wrong directories.
If you notice any missplaced mappings or know where an unmapped class can be appropriately mapped then send us a pull request.

### mappings.txt
Format: `ClassName|Path/To/Mapping`

### TODO

- Finish mapping class names correctly
- Make the source readable.
